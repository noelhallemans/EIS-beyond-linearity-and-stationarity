# EIS-beyond-linearity-and-stationarity

Here we share data and code discussed in the paper "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy beyond linearity and stationarity---A critical review" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468623011143). These are free to use! However, if you use this data/code for publications, I would ask you to cite the paper. 

The MATLAB script `writeORPmultisine.m` generates a sampled odd random phase multisine. Such a multisine can be written in a text file and applied through a potentiostat that can apply user-defined excitations (for instance the Gamry Interface 5000E).

In the folder `Data Samsung 48X`, odd random phase multisines are applied to a Li-ion battery using the Gamry Interface 5000E. The battery we use is the commercially available Samsung INR21700-48X cell, a 4.8 Ah 21 700 cell format with cathodes based on lithiated metal oxide (Co, Ni, Al) and anodes based on intercalation graphite and blended Si. Measurements are performed in a thermal chamber at 5°C and 25°C.

For classical EIS experiments (`classicalEIS_25degrees.mat` and `classicalEIS_5degrees.mat`), the multisine is applied in steady state at different SOC levels (10,20,...,80% at 5°C and 10,20,...,90% at 25°C). 10 periods of the multisine are measured. The MATLAB script `classicalEIS.m` plots the measured data at a particular temperature and SOC, and estimates the impedance. Using this data and code one can recreate Fig. 3, 11 and 14 of the paper.

For operando EIS experiments (`operandoEIS_25degrees.mat` and `operandoEIS_5degrees.mat`), the multisine is applied superimposed on a C/2 charging current (2.4 A). At 5°C and 25°C, 29 and 31 periods of the multisine are measured, respectively. The MATLAB script `operandoEIS.m` plots the measured data. We also include estimated time-varying impedance data using operando EIS (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877532200982X). Using this data and code one can recreate Fig. 9, 15 and 16 of the paper.
